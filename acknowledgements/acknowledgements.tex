\begin{acknowledgements}

This work would not have been possible without the thoughtful guidance and continual assistance of my wonderful supervisor, Auriol Degbelo. I would also like to thank my co-supervisors, Chris Kray and Marco Painho, for supporting me from the beginning and providing valuable advice and feedback. It was Professor Kray's class on location-based services and his personal encouragement that inspired me to take on this topic. I would not have gotten very far without the help of my unofficial supervisors, Ana Maria Bustamante Duarte and Catharina Riedemann, who generously shared their passion and experience in their subject areas. I am incredibly grateful to all the forced migrants and freecyclers who welcomed me into their circles and generously shared their time and ideas, whether as formal participants or not. I would also like to thank Christoph Brox and Chris Kray for providing funding for the final study of the thesis. I thank my classmates in the Master of Geospatial Technologies for their companionship and help translating and testing the prototype app. Special thanks to Daniel Marsh-Hunn for coming up with the idea of a location-based freecycling service with me, for helping to develop the original prototype, and for coming up with the name Geofreebie. Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and friends for their free editorial services and abundant moral support.
