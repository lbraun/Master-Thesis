\subsection{Forced Migrants}

The following five tables show the various context elements we extracted from the interviews with forced migrants in phase one of the study (see chapter~\ref{cha:needs}), along with the percentage of the interviews in which they appeared. The sixth table lists ideas that we collected from participants during the interviews about how to support forced migrant resettlement in regards to social isolation.
