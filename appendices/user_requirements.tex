The following is a list of all the user requirements that came out of the context interviews with our forced migrant participants. User requirements marked with an asterisk (*) are identical or nearly identical to user requirements that emerged from the interviews with freecyclers.

User requirements are actions that a user must be able to perform with the system in order to fulfill one of the implied needs efficiently. For this reason, they are basically the implied needs rephrased in terms of a system. It should be noted that while the requirements mention the system, they do not mention any specific technical solutions.
