The design of a location-based freecycling service that reduces the social isolation of forced migrants requires 
a) an understanding of social isolation as it occurs in forced migrant communities, 
b) a consideration of the best practices and common concerns when developing ICT to address forced migrant challenges,
c) an evaluation of the unique strengths and weaknesses of geospatial technologies in this area,
d) an understanding of the strengths and limitations of freecycling platforms for promoting positive social contact, and
e) the selection of a design process that effectively meets forced migrant needs.
Following is a short summary of past research on each of these five topics.

\section{Summary}

In this chapter, we have attempted to summarize past research on social isolation in the context of forced migration and the use of ICT to address this and other forced migrant challenges. We highlighted areas that need more research, including 1) the development of services that are explicitly designed to reduce the social isolation of forced migrants and 2) the adaptation of existing promising technologies – such as geospatial technologies, location-based services, and freecycling systems – to the unique needs of forced migrants. Our review of this literature led us to our research question and guided our methodology, as explained in the chapter that follows.
